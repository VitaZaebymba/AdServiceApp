# AdServiceApp "a'Vita"
My first pet-project is an application for the Android operating system in the Kotlin. A service for placing ads.

Users can register, view ads, create ads, edit them, communicate with sellers, etc. Authorization takes place via mail, or using a Google account. The Firebase Realtime Database is used as a database.
