# AdServiceApp "a'Vita"
My first pet-project. A service for placing ads, an analogue of the Russian application "Avito".

Users can register, view ads, create ads, edit them, communicate with sellers, etc. Authorization takes place via mail, or using a Google account. The Firebase cloud storage is used as a database.
